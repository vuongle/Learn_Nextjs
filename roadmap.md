### 4. Data Fetching

- **Static Generation (getStaticProps)**: Fetch data at build time.
- **Server-Side Rendering (getServerSideProps)**: Fetch data on each request.
- **Client-Side Fetching**: Use React hooks (e.g., `useEffect`) for client-side data fetching.

### 5. API Routes

- **Code Splitting**: Understand how Next.js automatically optimizes code splitting.
- **Lazy Loading**: Learn how to lazy load components and images.

### 9. Deployment

- **Vercel**: Deploy your Next.js application on Vercel (the creators of Next.js).
- **Other Hosting Options**: Explore deployment options on platforms like AWS, Netlify, or DigitalOcean.

### 10. Advanced Topics

- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Learn how to implement multi-language support.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Understand how to update static content after deployment.
- **Middleware**: Explore Next.js middleware for advanced routing and authentication.

### 11. Building Projects
